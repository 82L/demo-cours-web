# Cumulative Art Maps Saved Locations

## Presentation
This project was made as a part of a web class drived by the use of web functionalities.

The goal of this website is to allow the user to save locations as maps 
to generate cumulative art based on the superposition of the maps.

At the end of it, it will create a special form of art, that will be specific to the user. 
Like a token based on all of his life experience.

The user can't remove any of the maps saved using normal manipulations, as it is like scars. They're witness of his past life.
